Issues Encountered During Task Execution
- During the task mix phx.gen.live Content Post posts title:string body:text user_id:references:users, several issues were encountered:

1. Dropdown for user name was not generated

2. Incorrect file was edited
While attempting to fix the dropdown issue, changes were mistakenly made to a file unrelated to the generated LiveView component. 
This led to confusion and caused errors during rendering. 
The correct file (typically in post section file) needed to be identified and edited instead.

3. Extra time was needed for debugging and manual fixes
Manual corrections were required in multiple areas, including:
- The LiveView form template
- Preload logic in the context
-Ensuring the schema included belongs_to :user
