1. Working on the group assignment and making progress with mix phx.gen.live slide
2. Recap the mix phx.gen.live task

What I learned:
- mix phx.gen.live is a command to generate real-time CRUD pages using Phoenix LiveView.
- It auto-creates files like LiveView modules, HTML templates, routes, and database schema.

Function:
- Makes it faster to build user interfaces that update without refreshing the page.
- Helps beginners understand the full flow (from database to frontend).

What I did:
- Ran the command in Cursor terminal.
- Explored the generated files (LiveView, HEEX templates, context)
- Migrated database using mix ecto.migrate.
