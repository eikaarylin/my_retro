- I encountered an error where the BMI Calculator button did not appear in the user interface (UI).
- I reviewed my code multiple times and asked ChatGPT to check if it was correct — and it was technically correct.
  Despite that, I still couldn't see the button on screen, and it took a long time to figure out the actual cause.
- The problem was not in the component or logic itself, but in how or where it was connected in the UI/router/layout — something small but crucial.

This experience helped me understand that:
- UI issues may not always be about code logic, but also about routing, component rendering, or naming.
