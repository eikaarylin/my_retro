1. Pattern Matching & def
- def is used to define functions.
- Pattern matching allows functions to handle different inputs based on their structure.

2. New Commands Learned
- IO.inspect → Prints a value for debugging.
- case → Similar to if/else, for condition handling.
- |> (Pipe) → Sends the output of one function into the next.
- <> (String Join) → Combines two strings.

Common string functions:
- String.length/1
- String.contains?/2
- String.slice/3
