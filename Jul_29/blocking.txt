1. Broken Pagination Code
- The pagination feature in the system is currently not functioning as expected. This issue became more apparent when I attempted to add additional functions to the page.

2. Too Much Code in a Single File, Menu Content Not Displaying After Splitting
- Initially, a lot of code was written within a single file, making it harder to manage, maintain, and scale. To improve this,
the code was modularized by separating it into multiple smaller files (e.g., splitting LiveViews, components, or templates).
However, after doing this, the content that was supposed to appear under certain menu tabs or sections is no longer being displayed.
This may be caused by incorrect module references, missing imports, improper LiveView routing, or failure to pass/assign the necessary
data or state to the separated files.
