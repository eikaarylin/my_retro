- ERD Understanding: Still facing some confusion in understanding how to properly connect entities with one another.
  Planning to revisit and refine the relationships from scratch for better clarity and structure.
- Pemohon Panel: Completed and working well â€” structure is clear and connections are defined.
- Other Panels: Still in progress. Currently reviewing and improving the relationships and table structures to ensure consistency
  and proper integration with the rest of the system.
