- Initially, dummy data was used for displaying user and admin information. This has been replaced with actual data fetched from the database to ensure
 real-time accuracy and consistency.

Implement Full Admin Control Functions:
- Add New Users (Not fully functions)
- Edit Existing User Information
- Delete Users
- Change User Roles (e.g., from user to admin or superadmin)

Dynamic Admin Dashboard with Live Statistics:
1. The admin dashboard now displays real-time statistics, dynamically calculated based on actual data from the database.

Examples of the statistics include:
- Total number of users
- Total number of admins
- Total activity logs
