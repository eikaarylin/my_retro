Encounter many error during adding the update profile section in setting page:
1. Profile Data Not Saving / “Something went wrong!”
Problem:
The form would not save, and you saw a generic error message.
The real cause was a crash in the LiveView due to incorrect flash assignment.
Fix:
Changed from assign(socket, flash: ...) to the correct put_flash(socket, :info, ...) and put_flash(socket, :error, ...) in your LiveView.
This is the only way to set flash messages in Phoenix LiveView.

2. Cannot Save Data / No Error Details
Problem:
You couldn’t see why the form failed to save.
Fix:
Added code to show detailed validation errors in the flash using put_flash(:error, ...) so you know exactly which field is invalid.
