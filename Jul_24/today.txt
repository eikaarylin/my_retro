1. Continued working on the technical documentation for Doc_App.
Tested the application, and it works well. The documentation is complete and can be used by others.
The tasks for admin, user, and homepage design are done. The only remaining task is to allow the admin to approve other users and grant them admin privileges.

2. MyILTP has been reviewed and approved by Sir.
The next step is to add the necessary details before exporting it into the PostgreSQL database.
