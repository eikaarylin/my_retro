1. Admin/User Page UI Enhancements
- This week, I focused on building and refining the structural UI components for both the Admin and User pages,
aiming for a cleaner and more intuitive layout that supports better navigation and responsiveness.

The work completed includes:
i. Sidebar Implementation:
Developed a collapsible sidebar layout that supports a modular navigation structure. Each menu item is dynamically generated and scoped according
to the user's role (admin/user). Styling was adjusted using utility classes (pl, px, py, pr) to maintain consistent spacing and alignment across different screen sizes.

ii. Navigation Setup:
Integrated a clear navigation hierarchy inside the sidebar with logical grouping of links. Ensured that each route transition is smooth and role-appropriate,
using conditional logic to redirect users after login based on their roles.

iii. Highlighted Active Menu:
The active or current menu item is now visually highlighted using Tailwind utility classes (e.g., border-left, background tone, or bold text)
so users always know which section they're currently in. This improves usability and orientation within the app.

iv. Burger Menu (Responsive Layout):
Added a responsive burger (hamburger) menu for smaller devices or mobile views. When clicked, it toggles the visibility of the sidebar.
This ensures the UI remains functional and user-friendly across different screen sizes and devices.



- pl (padding-left) for indentation and alignment within the sidebar.
- px (padding left + right) and py (padding top + bottom) for internal component padding.
- pr (padding-right) to maintain spacing between text and icons.
- py (padding on the top and bottom) of an element.
